# Week 2 - 2024: Advanced Vue 3 Patterns

## What I Learned

This week I focused on **advanced Vue 3 patterns** and performance optimization techniques. The Composition API is truly powerful when used correctly.

### Key Takeaways:
- **Composables** are game-changers for code reusability
- **Reactive patterns** can significantly improve performance
- **Pinia** is much simpler than Vuex for state management

## Projects Worked On

### Personal Website Improvements
- âœ… Implemented dark mode with CSS variables
- âœ… Added smooth animations with Motion for Vue
- âœ… Optimized bundle size by 30%
- ðŸ”„ Working on SEO optimization

### Performance Optimizations
- [x] Implemented lazy loading for images
- [x] Added service worker for caching
- [x] Optimized font loading
- [ ] Add PWA features

## Technical Deep Dive

### Custom Composable Example
```typescript
// useTheme.ts
export const useTheme = () => {
  const isDark = ref(false)
  
  const toggleTheme = () => {
    isDark.value = !isDark.value
    document.documentElement.classList.toggle('dark')
  }
  
  return { isDark, toggleTheme }
}
```

## Challenges Faced

The biggest challenge was optimizing the **bundle size** without sacrificing functionality. I had to carefully analyze which dependencies were actually needed and find lighter alternatives.

## Next Week's Goals

1. Complete PWA implementation
2. Add analytics and monitoring
3. Start working on blog content
4. Implement search functionality
