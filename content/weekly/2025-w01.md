# Week 1 - 2024: Getting Started with Nuxt 4

## What I Learned

This week I dove deep into **Nuxt 4** and its new features. The most exciting discovery was the improved performance and the new composables system.

### Key Takeaways:

- **TypeScript** support is now first-class

## Projects Worked On

### Personal Website
- âœ… Set up Nuxt 4 project structure

- âœ… Added Tailwind CSS configuration
- ðŸ”„ Working on responsive design

### Learning Goals
- [x] Complete Nuxt 4 documentation reading
- [x] Build a simple blog with Nuxt Content
- [ ] Deploy to production

## Challenges Faced

The main challenge was understanding the new **Nitro** engine and how it differs from the previous version. The documentation was helpful, but I had to experiment a lot to get things working properly.
