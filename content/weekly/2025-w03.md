# Week 3 - 2024: Full Stack Development with Nuxt

## What I Learned

This week I explored **full-stack development** with Nuxt 4, building both frontend and backend functionality in a single framework.

### Key Takeaways:
- **Server routes** in Nuxt are incredibly powerful
- **Database integration** with Prisma is seamless
- **API design** patterns for modern web apps

## Projects Worked On

### E-commerce Platform
- âœ… Set up Prisma with PostgreSQL
- âœ… Implemented user authentication
- âœ… Built product catalog API
- ðŸ”„ Working on shopping cart functionality

### API Development
- [x] RESTful API design
- [x] JWT authentication
- [x] Input validation with Zod
- [ ] Rate limiting implementation

## Technical Implementation

### Server Route Example
```typescript
// server/api/products/[id].get.ts
export default defineEventHandler(async (event) => {
  const id = getRouterParam(event, 'id')
  
  const product = await prisma.product.findUnique({
    where: { id: parseInt(id) },
    include: { category: true }
  })
  
  if (!product) {
    throw createError({
      statusCode: 404,
      statusMessage: 'Product not found'
    })
  }
  
  return product
})
```

## Database Schema Design

```prisma
model User {
  id        Int      @id @default(autoincrement())
  email     String   @unique
  name      String?
  orders    Order[]
  createdAt DateTime @default(now())
}

model Product {
  id          Int      @id @default(autoincrement())
  name        String
  description String?
  price       Decimal
  categoryId  Int
  category    Category @relation(fields: [categoryId], references: [id])
  orderItems  OrderItem[]
}
```

## Challenges Faced

The main challenge was **database schema design** and ensuring proper relationships between entities. I had to refactor the schema multiple times to get the optimal structure.

## Next Week's Goals

1. Complete shopping cart functionality
2. Add payment integration
3. Implement order management
4. Add admin dashboard
