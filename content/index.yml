      questions:
        - label: What technologies do you specialize in?
          content: |
            I specialize in modern JavaScript/TypeScript ecosystems including Vue.js, React, Node.js, and Nuxt.js for full stack development.
            For backend, I work with Express.js, Fastify, PostgreSQL, MongoDB, and Redis. I'm experienced with cloud platforms like AWS,
            Alibaba Cloud, and containerization with Docker and Kubernetes. I also implement CI/CD pipelines and monitoring solutions.
        - label: What types of applications do you build?
          content: |
            I build a wide range of applications including e-commerce platforms, SaaS products, API-first applications, real-time applications
            with WebSocket, microservices architectures, and progressive web apps. I focus on scalable, maintainable code with proper testing
            and documentation.
        - label: Do you handle DevOps and deployment?
          content: |
            Yes! I handle the complete deployment pipeline including containerization, cloud infrastructure setup, CI/CD automation,
            monitoring, and performance optimization. I ensure your applications are production-ready and scalable.
    - title: Project Management & Pricing
      questions:
        - label: How much does a full stack project cost?
          content: |
            Project costs vary based on complexity, features, and scale requirements. Simple web applications start around $8,000,
            while complex enterprise solutions can range from $25,000 to $100,000+. For consulting or code reviews,
            my daily rate is $800. I provide detailed estimates after understanding your requirements.
        - label: What is your development process?
          content: |
            I follow an agile development approach with regular sprints and demos. The process includes requirements analysis,
            system architecture design, database schema design, API development, frontend implementation, testing, deployment,
            and ongoing support. I maintain clear communication and provide regular progress updates.
        - label: How long does development typically take?
          content: |
            Timeline depends on project scope. Simple web applications take 4-6 weeks, medium complexity projects take 8-12 weeks,
            and enterprise applications can take 3-6 months. I provide detailed project timelines with milestones during the planning phase.
        - label: Do you provide ongoing maintenance and support?
          content: |
            Yes, I offer maintenance packages including bug fixes, security updates, performance monitoring, feature enhancements,
            and infrastructure management. I also provide monthly retainer options for ongoing development needs.
    - title: Technical Approach
      questions:
        - label: How do you ensure code quality and scalability?
          content: |
            I follow best practices including writing comprehensive tests (unit, integration, e2e), implementing proper error handling,
            using design patterns, conducting code reviews, and maintaining clear documentation. I also implement monitoring and
            logging to ensure system reliability and performance.
        - label: What are your favorite technologies to work with?
          content: |
            I love working with Vue.js and Nuxt.js for frontend development due to their developer experience and performance.
            For backend, I enjoy Node.js with TypeScript for type safety. I'm passionate about PostgreSQL for relational data
            and Redis for caching. Docker and Kubernetes make deployment and scaling enjoyable.
